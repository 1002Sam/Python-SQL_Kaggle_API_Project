# Python-SQL_Kaggle_API_Project
This project demonstrates the extraction of data from the Kaggle API to a Jupyter Notebook, transformation and cleaning using Pandas and related libraries, and loading the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database managed with pgAdmin via a server connection. The workflow ensures efficient data handling from raw extraction to structured storage.

# Retail Orders Data Analysis Project

This project showcases the end-to-end process of extracting data from the Kaggle API, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing in a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and related libraries, and loading the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database managed with pgAdmin.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted retail orders data from Kaggle API into a Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA using Pandas and related libraries to understand the data and extract meaningful insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Performed data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.
4. **Data Loading**: Loaded the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database, managed with pgAdmin, via a server connection.
5. **Database Manipulation**: Utilized pgAdmin for various data manipulations as per problem-solving requirements.
