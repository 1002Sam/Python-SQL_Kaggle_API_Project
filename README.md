# Python-SQL_Kaggle_API_Project
This project demonstrates the extraction of data from the Kaggle API to a Jupyter Notebook, transformation and cleaning using Pandas and related libraries, and loading the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database managed with pgAdmin via a server connection. The workflow ensures efficient data handling from raw extraction to structured storage.
